// a lookup table is used in C to search and obtain items (like preprocessor directive of #define, to replace certian text to another) in avg O(1) time, worst case (with collisions) O(n) time
    /* 3 tpyes of loopup
        1. arr
        2. binary tree
        3. hash map

        Hash Table lookup:
        Uses array of ptrs to structures  (also called Linked lists)

        Each struct contains:
            1. a member for  word => ptr to char
            2. a pair to first member ( 2nd word)
            3. ptr to next struct at same index of main arr

            The irst node at this index is called head node which is a ptr ofc) and each of these structs hold a member with a ptr to another struct, each ptr holding 1 struct adr. This members in each struct creates chain for successive nodes which had arrived at the same index of a hashtable.

            Note: hashtables are not structs themselves but, array of pointers to structs,  Because:
                The array itself lives on the stack (or global data segment)
                The structs (nodes) live on the heap, dynamically allocated via malloc
                The pointers in the hash table array link these two worlds.

            note: <datatype> ptrs in the hashtable == ptrs stored for chaining in each struct.

            Are all table lookups a hashmap?

                üö´ Not necessarily ‚Äî ‚Äútable lookup‚Äù is a broader concept.
